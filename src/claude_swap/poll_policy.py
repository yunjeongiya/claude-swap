"""Cadence policy for the ``/api/oauth/usage`` endpoint — every number in one place.

The endpoint enforces a budget on non-first-party clients: a **~60-minute
window of ~28-30 requests per identity × UA-class** (measured 2026-07-11,
probe3, two runs: a rested identity admitted 30 requests before the first
429; the post-drain 429 oscillation ended exactly when the drain burst aged
60 minutes; steady 1/180 s polling then ran 96 minutes from a rested window
with zero 429s). It is NOT a bucket with a refill rate: capacity returns
only as old requests age out of the trailing hour, so a burst saturates the
identity for up to a full hour — pausing does not restore headroom early,
and earlier "refill rate" estimates were artifacts of measuring while
saturated.

What that identity is depends on which 429 regime the org is on — the two
regimes coexist across orgs (see the Retry-After discussion in
``usage_store``). Under the fixed-deadline regime it is the **account/org**
(measured 2026-07-28: a freshly minted token was blocked 135 s after issue,
which a per-token counter cannot produce). Under the saturated-edge
(``Retry-After: 0``) regime it is the **access token** (measured 2026-07-29,
probe4: at saturation, a freshly minted token of the same lineage was
admitted while the old token stayed blocked, requests interleaved). Plan for
the account-scoped case — it is the conservative one: re-authenticating
cannot be relied on to clear a block, and two machines holding different
tokens for one account may share one budget, which is what
``POST_429_BACKOFF_MULT`` below exists to converge.

Error bars: the horizon is bracketed to ~55-64 minutes from a single
transition event, the exact edge algorithm (likely a Cloudflare
sliding-window approximation) is undocumented, and Anthropic can retune it
any day — so the constants below lean only on the robust parts: a sustained
rate safely under the cap, and an ~hour recovery horizon. The budget target
is an **average of at most ~1 request / 3 minutes** (20/hour vs the ~28-30/
hour cap), leaving ~8-10 requests/hour of headroom for manual commands,
wake-from-sleep catch-up, and the bounded urgent mode below.

Health invariant to watch in the logs: steady state shows zero http-429.
A post-burst 429 does NOT reliably clear at its stated horizon — measured
over one machine's full log (re-measured 2026-08-03; re-derive rather than
trust this verbatim, it ages as the log grows — method recorded next to
``usage_store.RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S``), 20 of 35 lapsed blocks re-blocked
within 900s of their own deadline (+2s..+887s), each for a fresh full hour
("of 35", not 38 raw gaps: 3 are negative — NOT a uniform mechanism (one has
no within-block revision at all, one is revised BACKWARD mid-block, one is
unchanged — see usage_store.RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S's comment for the per-gap
detail) — excluded from both numerator and denominator; round 8 switched
from the prior "21 of 36"/"2 of 38" figures here to these, on the OTHER of
two equally-reproducing readings — see usage_store.RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S's
comment for which reading and why).
The prior "10 of 23" figure here did not reproduce under any of 40 method
variants swept and is superseded. That is why the wait is Retry-After plus
``usage_store.RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S`` and not Retry-After alone. What would
mean this model needs revisiting is a 429 episode at modest rates that
outlasts an hour *past* that margin.

Plans computed here are persisted per account in the usage store
(``nextPollAt``/``pollIntervalS``) by whichever collector fetched, so every
surface — ``cswap list``, the TUI, the menu bar, the auto engine — inherits
the same cadence no matter how often it repaints.

If a future probe revises the measured shape, adjust the constants in this
module only.
