        Three things the first cut got wrong, all of them the same promise —
        THE BYTES SURVIVE AND THE USER KNOWS:

        MODE. `shutil.copy2` preserves the source mode. Measured on a 0644
        `~/.claude.json` holding `primaryApiKey`: the replacement got 0600 from
        `_write_json` and the salvage stayed 0644, so the secret ended up
        world-readable in a file cswap created. Copied without metadata and
        chmod'ed 0600 explicitly.

        COLLISION. The stamp is second-resolution and `copy2` onto an existing
        name overwrites. Two failed switches inside one second left ONE file —
        measured, the first user's data unrecoverable. The retry is exactly
        what a user does next, so the guard lost the bytes precisely when it
        was needed. A counter suffix makes each copy its own file.

        NAME. The first cut stamped with `get_timestamp()`, whose ISO form
        carries `:` — forbidden in a Windows filename. Measured on CI (run
        30774451162): five tests died with `[Errno 22] Invalid argument`, the
        copy raised, and the switch ABORTED, which is worse than the data loss
        this guard exists to prevent. `int(time.time())` is what
        `credentials.py`'s sibling `.corrupt-` aside already uses; reusing it
        keeps one convention rather than inventing a third.

        VISIBILITY. `warnings_out` is only rendered by the JSON envelope. In
        human mode the user saw "Activated Account-1" and nothing else while
        their `projects`/`mcpServers` were gone from the live config — every
        other `warnings_out.append` in `_perform_switch` is paired with an

        account's email against another account's token.

        Two fallbacks stay inside that profile. An env var naming the default

        ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude`` may only have the unsuffixed item.
        A managed API key sits outside any OAuth store, and

        once and only after a successful write.

        "successor" byte-identical to what the store now holds, and a
        successful refresh is demoted to ``transient`` (measured: the tick then
        emits "could not freshen any candidate (network?)" forever over a

        site, and saying "the single place" instead sends the next reader

        newer lineage); ``error`` carries the refresh failure unchanged. Every

        Those are two different sources and nothing made them agree.

        Measured in the field: a session registered one account's address
        and the slot received a different account's token — an ssh session had
        ``.claude.json`` renamed to the new profile while the live keychain
        item still held the original account's credential. The slot ends up
        LABELLED one account and CONTAINING another, so every later switch to
        it logs the wrong user in and ``--status`` shows a name that is not
        whose token is stored. Nothing surfaces the disagreement.

        ``fetch_oauth_profile`` already answers exactly this ("whose token is
        this") and the autoswitch identity oracle already uses it. Compared
        UUID-FIRST, like ``_resolved_matches_slot_identity``: uuids are stable
        where an email can be recycled across accounts, so the EMAIL decides
        only when the slot carries no uuid to compare. The org is corroborated
        either way -- a uuid match under a disagreeing org is another account.

        An expired ACCESS token is UNRESOLVABLE here, not refreshed. A live
        refresh token would revive it, but spending that grant is a
        coordinated transition everywhere else in this class -- under the
        account FileLock and CC's credential locks, with the successor
        persisted to BOTH stores, because an accepted rotation retires its
        predecessor server-side. Refreshing here would strand the active store
        on the spent generation, and on the refusal path would discard the
        only live copy of that lineage. Detecting an expired FOREIGN
        credential is real and belongs on that machinery, not here; the field
        incident's shape is a live token, which this still catches.

        ADVISORY, in the same direction the oracle is everywhere else: a
        ``None`` answer means UNRESOLVABLE (offline, 401, schema drift), never
        "wrong", and must not block a registration that worked before this
        guard existed. Only a resolved identity that DISAGREES refuses. One
        level down, ``organizationUuid: None`` means the profile response
        carried no organization block at all — structurally ABSENT, not

        token under Claude Code's own lock protocol.

        Claude Code 2.1.218 is built to *adopt* an externally rotated
        credential rather than collide with it: its refresh takes the
        ``.oauth_refresh.lock`` + legacy ``.claude.lock`` pair, re-reads the
        store under the lock, and skips the network call when the token
        already changed (race-resolved); its 401 path re-reads the store
        before forcing re-auth. So a rotation performed under those same
        locks — re-check, POST, persist, release, all inside — is serialized
        against a live Claude Code and then adopted by it. An owner being
        present is therefore no longer a reason to leave an expired token
        dead (the old behavior stranded idle machines: the owner never
        refreshed, and the dead token 401'd the identity probe, cascading
        into ``unresolved`` switch bounces).

        Two invariants:

        - **Provenance (issue #117)**: a live credential is only CONSUMED
          (its grant POSTed) or WRITTEN into the slot backup when its
          lineage is attributed to the slot — backup-lineage match, a
          profile-oracle verdict from the fresh pass (see
          ``_resync_rotated_backup``), or a refresh POST of our own (memoed
          in ``_probe_verdicts``). Unattributable live bytes are never
          consumed or persisted — but when they are *dead* (expired) and
          the slot's own backup still holds a usable credential, the backup
          is restored to the live store: the backup is by definition the
          slot's credential, so no foreign lineage can be poisoned by it
          (measured field case: a stale cross-machine sync landing an
          already-superseded credential).
        - **Never discard a consumed generation**: once the refresh grant is
          POSTed, the successor is persisted unconditionally (active store +
          slot backup; backup even survives a failing live write). A consumed
          generation left as the live credential is the account-death shape —
          the token endpoint rejects its reuse (verified: invalid_grant on
          re-presentation, siblings unaffected).

        The fresh-token fast path serves usage off a credential the server
        just accepted. When that credential's lineage differs from the slot
        backup, Claude Code rotated during normal use and nothing resynced
        the backup (rotation-before-collection): the backup still holds the
        consumed predecessor, and the next expiry's recovery branch would
        POST that dead grant — invalid_grant on a healthy slot. This is the
        adopt-branch resync extended to a rotation that already completed:
        same identity re-check, same full-token-pair guard, same locks.

        The config identity alone cannot attribute the drifted bytes: a
        foreign credential can occupy the live store while ``~/.claude.json``
        still names this slot (partial cross-machine sync of the credential
        store; a poll landing inside ``/login``'s non-atomic write), and
        writing those bytes would destroy the slot's only surviving refresh
        token. So the drifted lineage — including the empty-backup *seeding*
        case — must be attributed by the profile oracle before it is
        persisted: probed here, before any lock (network under locks is
        forbidden), while the access token is known-fresh (the usage
        endpoint just accepted it). Definitive verdicts are memoized per
        lineage so a persistent drift state doesn't re-probe every pass.

        Best-effort: any failure (lock contention, read error, identity
        moved, oracle unreachable) just leaves the backup stale — the
        recovery branch consumes nothing it cannot attribute. Never raises.

          nothing changed, nothing to capture.
        - ``"own-family"``     — same refresh-token lineage (access token
          rotated); back up normally.
        - ``"own-rotated"``    — full rotation, but the profile endpoint
          resolved the live token to this slot's identity; back up normally
          (the live→backup re-sync that keeps slots alive across Claude
          Code's routine refresh-token rotations).
        - ``"foreign"``        — uuid-positively resolved to *another* managed
          slot (``foreign_slot``) holding a different lineage; backing it up
          here would destroy this slot's only refresh token (issue #117's
          poisoning). Preserved in a safety copy, never written into any
          slot: identity proves ownership, not generation freshness.
        - ``"foreign-synced"`` — resolved to another managed slot whose
          stored backup already holds this exact lineage; nothing needs
          preserving, nothing may be written.
        - ``"wiped"``          — an OAuth blob whose token fields are all
          empty: Claude Code's ``invalid_grant`` reaction empties
          ``accessToken``/``refreshToken`` in place, keeping the wrapper and
          metadata (observed live on 2.1.181). No token → the identity
          oracle is structurally silent, so this used to fall to
          ``"unresolved"`` and the fail-open backup copied the empty tokens
          over the slot's only surviving refresh token. Never written into
          any slot; nothing worth preserving either.
        - ``"alien"``          — a *structurally complete* identity (uuid +
          email + organization) that matches no managed slot (unmanaged
          login, recycled email wearing a managed address, or an email+org
          match without uuid confirmation). Preserved in a safety copy.
        - ``"known-foreign"``  — the switch-time oracle failed, but a
          collect-pass probe in this process already condemned this exact
          lineage (a cached definitive verdict, revalidated against the
          slot's current identity). Routed like ``"alien"``: preserved,
          never written — a transient probe failure must not let the
          fail-open backup poison the slot with bytes we have already
          proven foreign (this switch may BE the repair that verdict
          triggered).
        - ``"unresolved"``     — mismatch and identity could not be
          established (offline, endpoint failure, malformed response, no
          access token in the blob, bytes moved since the pre-lock read) —
          or was only *partially* established: a response missing email or
          organization matching nothing is indistinguishable from schema
          drift, and preserve-and-skip on drift would silently recreate the
          fail-closed behavior this design forbids. The caller falls back to
          the exact pre-fix backup: the identity oracle is advisory, and
          endpoint state must never change switch behavior beyond skipping
          the extra safety.
