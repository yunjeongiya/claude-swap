class TestEngineHarnessIsolation:
    """Pins the guarantee `EngineHarness.__init__`'s per-instance isolation
    exists for (see its docstring): two harnesses built against the SAME
    `temp_home` must not resolve to the same store.

    The prior form of this guard had no test that could kill it — reverting
    the scoping left the full suite green
    (`test_a_non_429_recorded_through_record_does_not_take_the_margin` no
    longer depends on it; that test's premise now stands on its own
    `record()` call). Without a test, a future cleanup could delete the
    isolation silently, and the next multi-harness test would alias two
    accounts' stores into one without any assertion noticing.

    An earlier fix scoped isolation on `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, which
    `get_backup_root()` only consults on LINUX/WSL (paths.py:101) — so
    the guard's OWN skipif, added because the mechanism is genuinely absent
    off Linux, also left the guard itself untested there (measured: skip
    forced + scoping reverted, full suite SURVIVED). The aliasing it
    guards against is real off Linux (direct probe: two harnesses on
    distinct subtrees collapsed to one store under the legacy
    ~/.claude-swap-backup path, and h1's seeded account silently became
    h2's). `Path.home()` is honoured by get_backup_root() on EVERY platform
    (both its XDG branch and its `get_legacy_backup_root()` fallback —
    paths.py:101-108), so scoping there instead makes the guard, and this
    test, load-bearing everywhere and lets the skipif be deleted.

    A "distinct subtree" harness (`EngineHarness(temp_home / "h1")`, the
    pattern this test and `decision_at()` in `TestAdaptiveScheduler` use)
    supports ONLY `seed()` and other `backup_dir`-scoped switcher calls.
    `Path.home()` is patched for `EngineHarness.__init__` only, not for the
    harness's lifetime, so after construction it reverts to whatever the
    ambient fixture set (the `temp_home` ROOT, not the subtree) — meaning
    `switcher.home` (cached at construction, `switcher.py:272`) disagrees
    with what any later `paths.*` call resolves. `make_live()` writes under
    `self.temp_home` (the subtree) and raises `FileNotFoundError` there
    (the subtree's `.claude/` is never created), and even if it didn't, the
    file would land somewhere production's own path resolution would not
    read. Do NOT call `make_live()` — or anything else that reads
    `paths.*` after construction — on a subtree harness; build it on
    `temp_home` directly instead (see `harness` fixture / `TestDecisionTable`).

        and is bounded AT it above — never left to park a row past the point
        `entries()` already reads it unknown.

        This test used to assert the opposite (`other == ask` at every ask up
        to 20000, i.e. no bound at all — `test_a_non_429_ask_passes_through_
        uncapped`). That was wrong: `_classify_usage_error` (oauth.py) parses
        Retry-After for ANY HTTPError code, not just 429, and the usage
        endpoint sits behind Cloudflare, which routinely emits Retry-After on
        503s. A `503 Retry-After: 86400` parked a row 24h with no bound at
        all — reproduced end-to-end (PR #197).

        A LATER FIX bounded it at `RETRY_AFTER_FLOOR_CAP_S` (4500) —
        reasoning "one ceiling for how long any ask can park a row" — but
        that is the 429 arm's ceiling, not this one's: `entries()` reads a
        non-429 row unknown once `TRUST_MAX_AGE_S` (3600) elapses past the
        last success, so a non-429 ask between 3600 and 4500 parked the row
        past its own trust for up to 900s (a regression against
        upstream/main introduced by this PR). The bound is now
        `TRUST_MAX_AGE_S`, the ceiling this arm's trust actually uses.

        Asks below the ceiling are asserted with `==`, not `<=`, so a
        reintroduced blanket clamp to something shorter still fails this

        A previous round clipped the 429 wait to `min(earliest reset, fetchedAt
        + ceiling) - now`, reading the row's remaining trust as a second
        deadline the wait had to respect. The reasoning was that a wait running
        past that instant leaves the row un-pollable AND unknown, which the
        unhealthy-tick counter converts into a failover.

        The blind window is real. Shortening the wait does not touch it.
        `entries()` decides trust from `lastGood`/`fetchedAt`, and `record()`
        writes both in the SUCCESS branch only — a 429 refreshes neither. So
        the instant the row goes unknown is fixed by the last SUCCESSFUL fetch,
        and no choice of backoff can move it by one second. A shorter wait only
        samples that same instant more often, at one request each.

        Asserted by driving two histories that differ ONLY in how long they
        waited, and reading `decision_value()` at fixed, cadence-independent
        instants either side of the window's own reset boundary — NOT by
        polling in a loop and reporting the first sample that observes the
        flip. A loop's report is only as precise as its own stride, so a
        stride that happens to divide the reset boundary (1800 % 1800 == 0)
        agrees with a finer one by coincidence, not because the mechanism was
        exercised: pick a stride of 2000 instead of 1800 and the same true
        mechanism reports a different (later, sampling-limited) instant,
        making the comparison look broken when nothing moved. Checking the
        same two fixed instants for every cadence removes the coincidence.

        900)` — the MEASURED band, a literal, independent of whatever
        `RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S` happens to be configured to — is the interval
        a 429 wait must clear.

        ROUND-7 FINDING: the previous form of this assertion compared
        `waited` (which the code under test computed AS `3600 +
        RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S`) against an upper bound of `3600.0 +
        RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S` — the SAME margin constant on both sides. So
        the upper edge of the band always equalled the wait itself, and
        `x < x` is false for any margin, including 0 and 450 — the assertion
        could not fail regardless of what the margin was set to. Mutation-
        confirmed: `RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S = 0.0` and `= 450.0` both still
        passed, and neutralising `oauth.relevant_windows` to always return
        `[]` (removing the scoped-window mechanism entirely) also still
        passed. Fixed here by comparing against `MEASURED_BAND_S`, a literal
        that does not consume `RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S`.

        The `for scoped in (3700, 4000, 4400)` loop that used to wrap this
        assertion is deleted: `_failure_backoff_s` takes no window argument,
        and the ONLY mechanism that ever made a scoped reset change the
        computed wait — a trust-based clip against a soon-resetting window
        — was removed in an earlier round (see `usage_store.py`'s "NO TRUST
        TRIM AGAINST THE SERVER'S DEADLINE"). All three scoped values
        therefore drove byte-identical `waited`; the loop exercised nothing
        that differed between iterations. A single scoped window is kept
        below (not swept) to confirm the record()->entries() round trip
        still produces the deadline+margin wait with a live scoped binding
        present, not to distinguish scoped values from each other.

        deleting `rate_limited=` from `record()` — so every 503/504 falls back
        to the `True` default and takes the 429-only margin again — left the
        whole suite green. `record()` is the only path production reaches, so
        the guard was untested where it runs.

        Drives a REAL success through `record()` first, so `last_good` and
        `fetched_at` actually exist and are decision-trusted before the 503.
        The defect this test previously carried recorded neither
        (`last_good=None, fetched_at=None`) and asserted a trust
        relationship that was never exercised — masked by `EngineHarness`
        instances sharing one store (see its docstring), which supplied a

        premise assertion now genuinely depends on the record() call above

        """The axis can flip more than once, and nothing bounded how often.

        A previous round measured A-B-A under burn and dismissed it: each leg
        IS legitimate on the axis its own state selects, and base shows 0 only
        because it refuses the outbound leg too. That reasoning holds. The
        conclusion did not — it rested on the walk settling in at most three
        moves, which is a property of the one shape that was measured.

        Measured, only the active burning at 0.5 pts/tick, both resets past
        the horizon, 24 ticks:

            pcts (96,92) resets (20h, 80h)    moves [2, 1]        settles
            pcts (92,92) resets (500h,400h)   moves [1, 2, 1, 2]  does not

        Base on both: a single move. Traced at each leg of the second shape —

            t8   1->2  headroom axis   active 4.0 / best 8.0
            t20  2->1  headroom axis   active 2.0 / best 4.0
            t22  1->2  recovery axis   active 3.0 / best 2.0

        The ratio gate is RELATIVE (`h >= active x 2`) and the spent gate
        ABSOLUTE (`active <= 3.0`), so burn walks the pair across the boundary
        repeatedly and each crossing re-opens a move. Extending to 120 ticks
        stops only because both accounts hit the 99.95 burn cap, so the fourth
        move is not a transient.

        Refusing the account we most recently left bounds it — but identity
        alone has no release, and on a 2-account fleet that is a permanent
        proactive lockout (see the sibling test). Released by asking the
        ranking, the walk is still BOUNDED: it ends, because each return has to
        clear the margin and burn makes that harder every time.

        A trace of the exact moves used to sit here. It has been re-taken three
        times and come back different every time — the walk depends on the
        release, and the release has changed in every round that quoted it. The
        assertion is on SETTLING for the same reason.

        So this asserts a BOUND, not zero returns. Zero was a property of the
        release-less filter, and that property is what made the lockout
        permanent. A walk that ends is the real requirement; the live incident
        this class documents was four moves in 35 minutes and still climbing.

        from the call site into `_no_return_account`, and this module has
        already shipped a bar whose unit was pinned while its wiring was not
        (see `test_the_bar_reaches_the_ranking_through_tick`). Measured here:
        dropping `kw["current"]` at the call site leaves a direct-call test
        of the gate entirely green.

        TYPES DIFFER ACROSS THE COMPARISON: `lastSwitchTo` is written from
        `_perform`'s `number: str` while `lastSwitchFrom` comes from
        `account_ref(number: int | None, ...)`. The `landed=2` / `live=2` row
        is the one a bare `==` fails — `2 != "2"` releases a bar that must
        hold — so the row asserting the HOLD is what pins the normalisation.

        ABSENT `lastSwitchTo` KEEPS THE BAR: a record written before the key
        existed cannot prove the engine moved away, and this module treats
        every other missing field the same conservative way. Letting absence
        disarm would silently drop the anti-flap bound for one upgrade cycle
        — the last row, whose engine stays put exactly like the on-landing
        rows.

        reported on. Measured on the emptiness-only release, sweeping active x
        barred headroom x both reset shapes through `_rank_candidates(
        no_return="1", oauth_candidates=["1"])`:

            n=2 barred-rank EMPTY=320 NONEMPTY=0

        So the retry fired every time and the bar never applied. The cited flap
        reproduced unchanged: pcts 92/92, resets 500h/400h, 60 ticks gave
        `[1, 2, 1, 2]` with the bar ON and `[1, 2, 1, 2]` with `lastSwitchFrom`
        popped every tick — identical, and worse than base's single move.

        WHAT SEPARATES THE TWO STATES is not the ranking, which only sees the
        present. It is whether the barred account is a different proposition
        from the one we left. At each leg of that walk it was not:

            t8   1->2   left 1 holding 4.0 pts, 500h out
            t20  2->1   account 1 holds 4.0 pts, 500h out   <- nothing changed
            t22  1->2   account 2 holds 2.0 pts, 400h out   <- nothing changed

        Every return won because the ACTIVE burned down, never because the
        target recovered. That is the flap, exactly.

        Both legs of the test below are the flap shape: the barred account is
        no better than we left it on either axis. The bar must hold even
        though the ranking is empty and the tick therefore does nothing.

        WALKED PAST THE OLD BOUNDARY: the pre-fix dominance leg was a bare
        `h > active x RATIO`, which held only up to and including ratio
        exactly 2.00 (`active=2.0` pts) and opened on the very next cell
        (`active=1.8`) — measured, on this fleet. The fixed leg adds a flat
        `+SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT` on top of the ratio, so the boundary against
        this same 4.0-pt frozen
        peer moves from `active=2.0` to `active=0.5` — the walk below covers
        every cell in between, well past where the bare ratio opened.
